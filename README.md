### Reflection:
 - When using grid:
   - Could not add “margin-left” to a single row without it affecting other rows.
    - Came up with using `justify-self:end` to come up with it visually showing a left margin
 - The columns had different heights due to the images and text not being the same size and length respectively:
    - Tried googling “grid columns not having the same height”
used `align-items:stretch` as well as
```
  grid-template-rows: max-content 350px 1fr;
```



### Flare:
 - Hover and colour themes:
    - `lines 188 to 252 in style.css`
